Gun buyback programs are government initiatives that invite members of the public to exchange guns for a financial reward. Buybacks have existed in the United States since the 1970s, but they've recently become frequent in New York City and greater New York, organized by the Attorney General and police departments. Here is some key information about how buybacks work, how they're funded and what effects they have. </p1>

  Since 2013, almost 3,500 guns have been collected through gun buyback events in the state of New York. Removing guns from communities is an attempt to reduce gun violence in the United States. When firearms are turned in, their serial numbers are recorded, then the guns are destroyed. </div>

   Rewards given in exchange for surrendered guns vary. Many buyback events have offered rewards in the form of grocery store giftcards. At a Sept. 24, 2022, buyback event in the Rockaways, anyone who brought an operable firearm received cash and an iPad. People who brought more than one weapon additionally received a $250 supermarket gift card. </div>

  In New York City, anybody can turn in a firearm to a police precinct in exchange for $200. Most of the rewards are paid for with "drug and gambling forfeiture." In August, one man printed more than 100 lower receivers on a 3D printer, brought them to a buyback in Utica, NY, and walked away with $21,000 in giftcards. </div>

  Gun buyback programs in New York operate under a "no questions asked" policy. Those bringing guns do not need to identify themselves or explain their ownership of the weapon. At a buyback in Utica in August, over half of the guns turned in were illegal "ghost guns," non-serialized weapons. Buybacks are marketed as ways to prevent future gun violence, but research shows they don't reduce homicides and suicides. Adjunct Professor Keith Taylor of John Jay College of Criminal Justice told Pew, “If the purpose is to provide a means for individuals to get rid of weapons from their households that they don’t want to have anymore, it absolutely is a good option." </div>
